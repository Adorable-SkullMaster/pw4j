# pw4j: Java Wrapper for Politics and War API
### Alex's APIs Covered:
- Nation and Nations API
- Alliances and Alliances API
- War and Wars API
- Tradeprice and Tradehistory API
- City and All-Cities API
- Applicants and Members API
- Alliance Bank API
- Nation-Military API
    
### Features
- Simple design to handle API requests.
- In-built cache system for faster requests.
- Easy object models that encapsulate JSON handling.
- Proper Exceptions are thrown on Connectivity failures or API Query failures.
- Don't need to worry about Alex's stupid API.

## Usage

Please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Adorable-SkullMaster/pw4j/wiki).

### Missing Features

War-Attacks API is missing. I am planning to support it in near future but delaying due to stupid JSON structure of the endpoint.
